        <h3>Production</h3>
        <p>Godzilla 1954 started in March after the Castle Bravo Nuclear Test in March 1954 which irradiated the Japanese fishing boat the Lucky Dragon No. 5 killing 1 and getting the remainder ofthe crew dangerously sick. The film was made in 9 months with the anti-nuclear message being there from the start. Godzilla was done by building a giant rubber suit and having a guy inside destroying models of Tokyo. The original suit was so dangerous that the actors usually fell over or becoming unconsious. Filming lasted 51 days in a Tokyo lot. The film was released on November 3, 1954.</p>
        <h3>Godzilla King of the Monsters!</h3>
        <p>This version of the film was the American edit of the film released worldwide on April 27, 1954 and was how the world was introduced to Godzilla. The original Japanese film's international rights was purchased by an American company that made changes to the film that would be more acceptable to American audiences. The serious tone was dumbed down to be more in line with American monster movies of the 50's. About forty minutes were removed and replaced with new footage with American actor Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin. This was the only version of the film that was released worldwide until the original was finally released outside of Japan in 2004.</p>
