           <p>Palindromes date back at least to 79 AD, as a palindrome was found as a graffito at Herculaneum, a city buried by ash in that year.This palindrome, called the Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in latin: "Sater Apero Tenet Opera Rotas" ("the sower Apero holds with effort the wheels"). It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word, the second letters from the second work, and so forth. Hense, it can be arrangd into a word square that reads in four different ways: horrizantally or vertically from either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. As such, they can be reffered to as palindrome.</p>
           <p>The palindrome Latin riddle "In girum imus nocteet consumimur igni" ("we go in a circle at night and are consumed by fire") describes the behavior of moths.It is likely that this palindrome is from medival rather than ancient times. The second word, barrowed from Greek, should properly be spelled gyrum.</p>
